    <p style="clear: left; width: 1000px; color: white;"> One of the aliens Ben possesses. XLR8 looks like a semi-armored velociraptor. XLR8 as a Kineceleran have black orbs on his feet, a black tail with 5 blue stripes, and big claws on his 3 fingers that can only open and claws. And part of his Kineceleran biology he also has a cone-like head and a protective visor that slides over his face. When the visor is lifted, one can see his blue face, green eyes, black lips, and stripes running under and in between his eyes; the rest of his head's features are unknown. He also wears a black bodysuit with a white strap in the middle with the omnitrix embedded in his chest. </p>
