        <h2> Appearances throughout main renditions</h2>

        <p> While under the effects of a cold in Side Effects, Wildmutt's fur discolors from its vivid orange to a pale
          yellowish-orange tone, and his lips and claws turn from black to a sickly dark green hue.</p>

        <p>
          In Ultimate Alien, 16-year-old Wildmutt looks mostly the same except his skin is lighter in color. While his
          lips were still black in the Ultimate Alien intro, they were in the same color as his fur in the actual
          series. He wore the Ultimatrix symbol on his chest. Kevin as Wildmutt shares these traits.
        </p>

        <p>
          In Omniverse, Wildmutt's lips have returned to being black and his forearms are a bit bigger. 16-year-old
          Wildmutt wears a green and white collar with the Omnitrix symbol.

          <td> Sense of hearing</td>
          <td> Wildmutt's higher hearing range can be taken advantage of, as high frequency noises like a Sonic Pitch
