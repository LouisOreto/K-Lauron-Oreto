        beast-like appearance further accentuated by its orange fur. Wildmutt doesn't have eyes but it makes up for it
        with it's amazing sense of smell and hearing. Wildmutt also have sharp claws and sharp teeth.  </p>

      <p style="width: 1000px; color: white">  Wildmutt first appeared in "And then there were ten" were he destroyed one of vulgax's

      <h2 style="color: white;"> Appearances throughout main renditions</h2>
      
      <p style="color: white;"> While under the effects of a cold in Side Effects, Wildmutt's fur discolors from its vivid orange to a pale
          yellowish-orange tone, and his lips and claws turn from black to a sickly dark green hue.</p>

      <p style="color: white;"> 
      In Ultimate Alien, 16-year-old Wildmutt looks mostly the same except his skin is lighter in color. While his
          lips were still black in the Ultimate Alien intro, they were in the same color as his fur in the actual
          series. He wore the Ultimatrix symbol on his chest. Kevin as Wildmutt shares these traits.
      </p>

      <p style="color: white;"> 
      In Omniverse, Wildmutt's lips have returned to being black and his forearms are a bit bigger. 16-year-old
          Wildmutt wears a green and white collar with the Omnitrix symbol.

          <td> Sense of hearing</td>

            Whistle or a Zaroffian's whistle can overwhelm his senses and stun him.</td>
