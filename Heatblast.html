    <p style="clear: left; width: 1000px;"> One of the aliens Ben possesses. He has a red, molten and rocky body and fiery head with a mask-like face. He radiates high amounts of heat, has oval-like feet with only two toes and a backtoe each, and he sports a rather volcanic look. He uses fire powers, hence the name Heatblast. </p>
    <br>
      <p style="width: 1000px"> Heatblast was the first alien that Ben transformed into as seen during the first episode the moment he puts the Omnitrix on, who proceeds to eventually burn the forest down upon trying the alien's powers. Below here is alterations to his powers and attacks of fire.</p>

      <h2> Appearances throughout main renditions</h2>
      
      <p> When under the effects of a cold in Side Effects, Heatblast's fiery skin (excluding his rocky body) turned blue.</p>

      <p> 
      In Ultimate Alien, Heatblast closely resembled Alan, only taller, not as skinny, slightly altered and his face shape was more similar to the Original Series. His eyes were no longer connected to the fire on his head. The rocks over his body changed, with a burnt black color and red markings on every edge of his rocky skin, resembling charcoal and his plasma body is a lighter shade of yellow.
      </p>

      <p> 
      In Omniverse, Heatblast looks the same as he did in Ultimate Alien, only his eyes are once again connected to the fire on his head, like in the Original Series. He is taller and more muscular, his face's design is different and his shoulder plates are slightly tilted up. His feet are also redesigned.
