    <h2 style="float: left"> Benjamin Kirby "Ben 10" Tennyson </h2>
    <p style="clear: left"> Benjamin Kirby "Ben" Tennyson franchise. He was an ordinary ten-year-old boy until he found the Omnitrix, a powerful watch-like device that allowed him to turn into ten different aliens. Though initially immature and clumsy, Ben grew to be a true hero. </p>
<h2 style="float: left">Appearance </h2>
  <p style="clear: left"> Ben's physical appearance has changed throughout the series from a ten-year-old to a sixteen-year-old. However, he retains some recurring characteristics. He has unkept brown hair, green eyes, pale skin, and he's quite skinny for his age, though he shows a lot of muscle definition due to being athletic.
    </p>
  <h2>Regular Appearances</h2>

   In the Omniverse flashbacks in which he was 5 years old, 
 Ben wore green overalls with a white shirt underneath it. White numbers saying "5 1/2" were on a black square in front of his overalls. </p>
